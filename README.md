## ðŸ”¹ Project Structure

```bash
Flashcards/
â”œâ”€ bin/ # compiled executable

## ðŸ”¹ How Save File Works
- File path: `data/cards.txt`
- Stores all flashcards in a simple line-by-line format.
- Multi-line flashcards are handled with an escape/unescape mechanism:
    - Each newline inside front/back is stored as `\n` in the file.
    - Loaded back into memory with original formatting intact.
- Example:
    > What is the capital\nof France?<br>
    > Paris
- **Do not edit manually unless you understand escape sequences,** or the program may misread flashcards.

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

    - If a duplicate front exists, you can choose to update the back
2. List flashcards
    - Choose menu option `2`
    - Displays all saved flashcards
3. Quiz mode
    - Choose menu option `3`

    - Move to next card with Enter
4. Quit
