â”‚  â”œâ”€ Storage.hpp
â”‚  â””â”€ Utils.hpp
â”œâ”€ data/          # save files (tracked only with .gitkeep)
â”‚  â””â”€ .gitkeep

> `data/cards.txt` is automatically created when the app runs.  
> Do **not** commit this file â€” it is ignored in Git.

## ðŸ”¹ How Save File Works
- File path: `data/cards.txt`
- Stores all flashcards in a simple line-by-line format.
- Multi-line flashcards are handled with an escape/unescape mechanism:
    - Each newline inside front/back is stored as `\n` in the file.
    - Loaded back into memory with original formatting intact.
- Example:
    > What is the capital\nof France?<br>
    > Paris
- **Do not edit manually unless you understand escape sequences,** or the program may misread flashcards.

## ðŸ”¹ Usage
1. Add flashcards
    - Choose menu option `1`
    - Enter question (front)
    - Enter answer (back)
    - If a duplicate front exists, you can choose to update the back
2. List flashcards
    - Choose menu option `2`
    - Displays all saved flashcards
    - Fromt the list, you can:
        - **Edit a card** -> choose card ID, update front/back
        - **Delete a card** -> choose card ID, confirm deletion
3. Quiz mode
    - Choose menu option `3`
    - Shows each question and waits for Enter to show answer
    - After seeing the answer, mark if you answered correctly
    - Move to next card with Enter
    - At the end, summary statistics are shown (total answered, correct, incorrect, percentage)
4. Quit
    - Choose menu option `4`
    - Saves all cards automatically

## ðŸ”¹ Development Notes
- Code is cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows
- `data/` folder is tracked using `.gitkeep`
- `cards.txt` is local, never tracked in Git
- Future improvements:
    - Search/filter cards
    - Shuffle quiz mode
    - Categories/tags for cards
    - Statistics and analytics
    - New methods of answering
    - CSV/JSON export of stats
    - Improved UI (TUI)
    - Spaced repetition algorithm
